The Treasure Hunt Challenge

In the ancient city of Numerica, a grand treasure hunt is organized every year. This year, the challenge is tougher than ever! Participants are given a map with multiple treasure chests, each containing a different amount of gold

coins.

Your task is to find the treasure chest with the maximum number of gold coins to claim the grand prize.

Rules of the Treasure Hunt:

You will be given antarray of integers, where each integer represents the number of gold coins in a treasure chest.

You must determine the chest with the highest amount of gold and report the number of gold coins in it.

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10°), representing the number of treasure chests.

The second line contains N space-separated integers, where each integer represents the

num = int(input())
gold_coins = list(map(int,input().split()))
print(max(gold_coins))

input() reads "10 50 20 90 30" (as a string).
.split() converts it to ["10", "50", "20", "90", "30"] (a list of strings).
map(int, ...) converts each string to an integer: [10, 50, 20, 90, 30].
list(...) ensures we store it as a list.
max(gold_coins) finds the largest number in the list.
print(...) displays the result.
